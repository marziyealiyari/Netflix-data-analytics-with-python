# 📊 Netflix Data Analytics & Content Strategy Insights

Analyze Netflix’s global catalog using Python to uncover genre gaps, regional content trends, and build content-based recommendations. This project blends data cleaning, visualization, NLP, clustering, and business strategy modeling — a full-stack data analyst case study.

---

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Understand global trends in Netflix content over time and across countries
- Identify underrepresented genres (content gaps) in key markets
- Analyze narrative trends using text mining on show/movie descriptions
- Cluster content based on description similarity
- Recommend titles based on content similarity and regional preferences

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Plotly, WordCloud)
- Natural Language Processing (TF-IDF)
- Clustering (KMeans, PCA)
- Data visualization (heatmaps, choropleths, word clouds)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📈 Key Insights

### 🔥 Global Trends
- Netflix’s catalog exploded in growth post-2015, especially for TV Shows.
- The U.S., India, and U.K. dominate content production.

### 🎭 Genre Patterns
- Dramas, Comedies, and Documentaries are most common.
- Genres like **Science & Nature** are globally popular but underrepresented in India.

### 🌍 Regional Content Gaps
| Country | Underserved Genres       | Trending Themes                         |
|---------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| India   | Documentaries, Sci-Fi     | family, romance, tradition, identity     |
| UK      | Reality TV, Animation     | murder, true, crime, twist               |
| Japan   | Romantic Dramas, Kids     | anime, school, life, emotions            |

> ✅ Data-driven suggestions: Produce more documentaries in India, localize crime thrillers in the UK, expand anime and teen dramas in Japan.

### 🤖 Recommender System
- A simple **content-based recommender** suggests similar titles using TF-IDF and cosine similarity on descriptions.

## 📌 Future Work

- Integrate user ratings/viewership for performance-based modeling
- Deploy via Streamlit or Dash for live demos
- Use BERT embeddings for richer NLP-based recommendations
- Build country-specific recommender systems using genre gaps + description clusters

## 📚 Data Source

- Dataset: [Netflix Titles Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows)

## 💡 Author Notes

This project simulates how a data analyst at Netflix might approach catalog expansion strategy — blending data exploration with business impact.

If you're a recruiter, data science peer, or mentor and have feedback, I'd love to hear it!
